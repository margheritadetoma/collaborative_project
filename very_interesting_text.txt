This is an extremely interesting text.
This is the sinergy of AStudent 
and BStudent efforts.

Meanwhile BStudent calls up AStudent. BStudent 
tells AStudent they has an improvement for this part of the text, 
BStudent will do this on a different branch so that there 
will be no interference with AStudentâ€™s work.
*PLACE HOLDER: BSTUDENT HAS A CRUCIAL IMPROVEMENT*

AStudent suddenly realizes that there is a 
very nice text, that copes very nicely with 
what BStudent is about to write. This is why 
AStudent is creating a new branch and writing 
the very nice text here. 
*PLACE HOLDER: ASTUDENT'S VERY NICE TEXT*



*CONCLUSIONS HERE! *
guys, it is a very sad conclusion...we cannot go to shopping today because we have too many bad things to do. :( 
*sad music*
bye.
....
bye again.



Before merging the two branches, AStudent
writes a very nice conclusion for the document
and commits it.
